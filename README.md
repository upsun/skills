## `using-upsun`

A comprehensive AI Coding Agent Skill for managing [Upsun](https://upsun.com) projects using the Upsun CLI.

### Overview

This skill enables your agent to help you manage Upsun projects through the Upsun CLI (v5.6.0+), covering:

- **130+ CLI commands** across 30 namespaces
- **Deployment workflows** with safe production deployment patterns
- **Environment management** including branching, merging, and synchronization
- **Backup and restore** operations with verification and safety checks
- **Resource scaling** and autoscaling configuration
- **Database operations** for PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis, and Valkey
- **Security and access** management for teams and users
- **Development tools** including SSH, tunnels, and log access

### Installation

#### Prerequisites

1. **Upsun CLI** v5.6.0 or higher installed and authenticated
   
   ```bash
   # Install Upsun CLI (if not already installed)
   curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/platformsh/cli/main/installer.sh | VENDOR=upsun bash

   # Or via brew
   brew install platformsh/tap/upsun-cli

   # Authenticate
   upsun auth:browser-login
   ```

2. **Claude Code** - Available at [claude.ai/code](https://claude.ai/code) or any other AI coding agent

#### Option 1: Plugin Installation (Recommended for Claude)

Install via Claude Code plugin system:

```bash
# In Claude Code, run:
/plugin marketplace add upsun/claude-marketplace
/plugin install upsun-skill

# Or if using a custom marketplace:
/plugin marketplace add YOUR_ORG/your-marketplace
/plugin install upsun-skill@your-marketplace
```

The plugin will automatically:
- Install the skill and all helper scripts
- Set up recommended permissions
- Make the skill available across all your projects

#### Option 2: Personal Skills Directory

Install for all your projects manually:

```bash
# Clone to personal skills directory
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills
cd ~/.claude/skills
git clone https://github.com/upsun/skills.git upsun

# Or download and extract
curl -L https://github.com/upsun/skills/archive/main.zip -o upsun.zip
unzip upsun.zip -d ~/<AGENT_CONFIG_FOLDER>/skills/

# Move files to the coding agent folder

mv using-upsun ~/<AGENT_CONFIG_FOLDER>/skills/upsun
```

### Configure Permissions

#### Plugin Installation (Automatic)

If you installed via `/plugin install`, recommended permissions are automatically suggested. Accept them to enable full functionality.

#### Manual Installation

Add Upsun CLI permissions to your Claude Code settings:

**For project-specific permissions**, create or edit `.claude/settings.local.json`:

```json
{
  "permissions": {
    "allow": [
      "Bash(upsun auth:*)",
      "Bash(upsun environment:*)",
      "Bash(upsun activity:*)",
      "Bash(upsun backup:*)",
      "Bash(upsun project:*)",
      "Bash(upsun logs:*)",
      "Bash(upsun resources:*)",
      "Bash(upsun metrics:*)",
      "Bash(upsun user:*)",
      "Bash(upsun organization:*)"
    ]
  }
}
```

**For global permissions**, edit `~/.claude/settings.json` with the same structure.

> Please refer to your specific agent documentation for configuring permissions.

### Verify Installation

1. Open your AI coding agent in a project or terminal
2. Ask it: "Can you help me deploy to Upsun?"
3. It should activate the Upsun skill and offer assistance

## Usage

The skill activates automatically when you mention Upsun-related tasks:

- "Deploy to Upsun"
- "Create a new Upsun environment"
- "Backup the production environment"
- "Check Upsun environment status"
- "Scale Upsun resources"
- "Manage Upsun users"

### Quick Start Examples

**Deploy to production:**
```
"Deploy my changes to the production environment on Upsun"
```

**Create and test a feature branch:**
```
"Create a new feature environment for testing my authentication changes"
```

**Health check:**
```
"Check the health of my production Upsun environment"
```

**Backup before changes:**
```
"Create a verified backup of production before I deploy"
```

**Resource optimization:**
```
"Audit resource usage across all my Upsun environments"
```

### Architecture

This skill uses a progressive disclosure architecture:

1. **SKILL.md** (entry point) - Workflow navigation and common operations
2. **references/** (on-demand) - Detailed documentation loaded as needed

This design minimizes context usage while providing comprehensive coverage.

### Contributing

Contributions are welcome! See [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) for development guidelines.

#### Adding Documentation

1. Update existing reference files in `references/`
2. Add cross-references to related documents
3. Update `SKILL.md` if adding commonly-used commands
4. Test that Claude can find and use the new documentation
